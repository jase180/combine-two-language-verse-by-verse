9 I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit—
9 我在基督裡說真話，並不謊言，有我良心被聖靈感動給我作見證。

2 I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
2 我是大有憂愁，心裡時常傷痛。

3 For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race,
3 為我弟兄，我骨肉之親，就是自己被咒詛，與基督分離，我也願意。

4 the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.
4 他們是以色列人，那兒子的名分、榮耀、諸約、律法、禮儀、應許都是他們的；

5 Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised![a] Amen.
5 列祖就是他們的祖宗；按肉體說，基督也是從他們出來的——他是在萬有之上永遠可稱頌的神！阿們。

6 It is not as though God’s word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.
6 這不是說神的話落了空。因為從以色列生的，不都是以色列人；

7 Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”[b]
7 也不因為是亞伯拉罕的後裔，就都做他的兒女，唯獨「從以撒生的，才要稱為你的後裔」。

8 In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring.
8 這就是說，肉身所生的兒女不是神的兒女，唯獨那應許的兒女才算是後裔。

9 For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”[c]
9 因為所應許的話是這樣說：「到明年這時候我要來，撒拉必生一個兒子。」

10 Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac.
10 不但如此，還有利百加，既從一個人，就是從我們的祖宗以撒懷了孕，

11 Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand:
11 雙子還沒有生下來，善惡還沒有做出來——只因要顯明神揀選人的旨意，不在乎人的行為，乃在乎召人的主——

12 not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”[d]
12 神就對利百加說：「將來大的要服侍小的。」

13 Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”[e]
13 正如經上所記：「雅各是我所愛的，以掃是我所惡的。」

14 What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!
14 這樣，我們可說什麼呢？難道神有什麼不公平嗎？斷乎沒有！

15 For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”[f]
15 因他對摩西說：「我要憐憫誰就憐憫誰，要恩待誰就恩待誰。」

16 It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.
16 據此看來，這不在乎那定意的，也不在乎那奔跑的，只在乎發憐憫的神。

17 For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”[g]
17 因為經上有話向法老說：「我將你興起來，特要在你身上彰顯我的權能，並要使我的名傳遍天下。」

18 Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
18 如此看來，神要憐憫誰就憐憫誰，要叫誰剛硬就叫誰剛硬。

19 One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?”
19 這樣，你必對我說：「他為什麼還指責人呢？有誰抗拒他的旨意呢？」

20 But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”[h]
20 你這個人哪，你是誰，竟敢向神強嘴呢？受造之物豈能對造他的說：「你為什麼這樣造我呢？」

21 Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?
21 窯匠難道沒有權柄從一團泥裡拿一塊做成貴重的器皿，又拿一塊做成卑賤的器皿嗎？

22 What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction?
22 倘若神要顯明他的憤怒，彰顯他的權能，就多多忍耐寬容那可怒、預備遭毀滅的器皿，

23 What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—
23 又要將他豐盛的榮耀彰顯在那蒙憐憫、早預備得榮耀的器皿上——

24 even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?
24 這器皿就是我們被神所召的，不但是從猶太人中，也是從外邦人中——這有什麼不可呢？

25 As he says in Hosea: “I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people; and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one,”[i]
25 就像神在何西阿書上說：「那本來不是我子民的，我要稱為我的子民；本來不是蒙愛的，我要稱為蒙愛的。

26 and, “In the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”[j]
26 從前在什麼地方對他們說『你們不是我的子民』，將來就在那裡稱他們為『永生神的兒子』。」

27 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
27 以賽亞指著以色列人喊著說：「以色列人雖多如海沙，得救的不過是剩下的餘數。

28 For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.”[k]
28 因為主要在世上施行他的話，叫他的話都成全，速速地完結。」

29 It is just as Isaiah said previously: “Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.”[l]
29 又如以賽亞先前說過：「若不是萬軍之主給我們存留餘種，我們早已像所多瑪、蛾摩拉的樣子了。」

30 What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;
30 這樣，我們可說什麼呢？那本來不追求義的外邦人反得了義，就是因信而得的義；

31 but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal.
31 但以色列人追求律法的義，反得不著律法的義。

32 Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.
32 這是什麼緣故呢？是因為他們不憑著信心求，只憑著行為求，他們正跌在那絆腳石上。
